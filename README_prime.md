=============

A community driven list of useful Scala libraries, frameworks and software. This is not a catalog of all the libraries, just a starting point for your explorations. Inspired by [awesome-python](https://github.com/vinta/awesome-python). Other amazingly awesome lists can be found in the [awesome-awesomeness](https://github.com/bayandin/awesome-awesomeness) list.

Also awesome is [Scaladex](https://index.scala-lang.org/), the searchable, tagged, and centralized index of Scala libraries.

Projects with over 500 stargazers are in bold.
